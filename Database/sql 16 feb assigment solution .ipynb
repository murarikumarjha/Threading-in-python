    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Database defined A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database. SQL databases define and manipulate data-based structured query language (SQL). Seeing from a side this language is extremely powerful. SQL is one of the most versatile and widely-used options available which makes it a safe choice, especially for great complex queries. But from another side, it can be restrictive. SQL requires you to use predefined schemas to determine the structure of your data before you work with it. Also, all of your data must follow the same structure. This can require significant up-front preparation which means that a change in the structure would be both difficult and disruptive to your whole system.\n",
    "\n",
    "A NoSQL database has a dynamic schema for unstructured data. Data is stored in many ways which means it can be document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based, or organized as a key-value store. This flexibility means that documents can be created without having a defined structure first. Also, each document can have its own unique structure. The syntax varies from database to database, and you can add fields as you go."
